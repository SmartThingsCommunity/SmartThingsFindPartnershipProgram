SmartThings Find is a service that helps you find your precious things easily and quickly.
It allows you to find everything with the SmartThings Find device as well as Galaxy devices. With SmartThings Find, you can locate your missing device, even if it is offline. SmartThings users can opt in to securely use their Galaxy smartphone or tablet to help others locate their lost devices. Once a device has been offline, it produces a BLE signal that can be received by other devices. If you report your device as lost via SmartThings Find, the signal can be detected by other Galaxy devices, which will then send the location data back to the SmartThings Find service.

## How Does It Work?

SmartThings Find uses BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) and UWB (ultra-wideband) technologies to help you quickly and easily locate your connected devices. 


## Why Choose SmartThings Find Device SDK?

With SmartThings Find Device SDK, you can easily test your devices on various chipsets using pre-developed samples.
